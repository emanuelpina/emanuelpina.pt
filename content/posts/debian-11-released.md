The most recent version of Debian, with the code name "Bullseye", [was released today](https://www.debian.org/News/2021/20210814)!

Debian is one of oldest Linux distributions, notorious for been stable and reliable. Used as base for [many other distributions](https://distrowatch.com/search.php?basedon=Debian#simple). And a popular choice to run on servers.

Debian sees a new release each two years (more or less) and in conjunction with their [Long Term Support](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) team, they promise at least 5 years of extended support for the each stable release.

I was waiting with special anticipation for this release, after recently [decided to stop relying on enterprise developed distributions](/my-first-year-with-linux-on-desktop/).

I'll now migrate my server from Ubuntu 20.04 to Debian 11 and, therefore, it was only logic that my first step should be update the tutorials on this blog. From the [initial server setup](/debian-server-initial-setup/), to install [Nginx](/nginx-installation-on-debian/), [PostgreSQL](/postgresql-installation-on-debian/) and [PHP](/php-installation-on-debian/), and finally installing [Nextcloud](/nextcloud-22-installation-on-debian/), all were updated to reflect the use of Debian 11.
